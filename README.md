# Top Products Task
We want to see how you would structure your code to meet this simple requirement and how you would verify correct functionality. Please donâ€™t spend any more than 2 hours on this task and feel free to add a file explaining your design decisions and any other thoughts.

Hint: get started by running `dotnet new angular`.

## In the ASP.NET Core application:
1. Load the following URL in your browser and look at the structure of the product data:
  https://web.goog.cdn.orbxdirect.com/misc/orbxproducts.json
   - Each product can support multiple simulators.
2. Create a simple database schema using EF core to hold this data.
   - Create an in-memory database provider.
   - Design an appropriate database schema with relationships.
3. Create a GET endpoint that takes a Simulator sim string as a parameter.
   - An example of a simulator name would be "fsx" or "p3dv1". The valid options are available in the product data JSON.
   - Get the products from the database and filter them to only include those belonging to the simulator requested.
   - Return to the client a response containing only the top 10 products in order of most to least expensive.

## In the Angular ClientApp:
1. Create a form with a simple text input field and submit button to request the top products for a particular simulator.
2. On submission of the form fetch the top products from the API endpoint you created.
3. Display the products in a table along with the current price.
   - Included table columns should be:
     - Product Name (Hyperlinked to the product link URL)
     - Platform
     - Current Price
     - Supported simulators
   - Clicking the table headers should sort the table by this column

Once complete, please commit and push your changes and create a pull request for review.

## To start the application
1. Server runs on port localhost:5000
   >cd API
   >dotnet run

2. Angular client runs on port localhost:4200
   >cd client
   >npm start

3. Go to browser tab 
   >localhost:4200

## Github workflow
My intention was 
- to create a TopProducts branch off the master
- commit my work to this branch
- create a Pull Request for code review prior to being able to merge to the master branch

NB ReadMe.txt file lists items not included because
   - unable to find solution to implement
   - project time constraints 
   - out of scope
